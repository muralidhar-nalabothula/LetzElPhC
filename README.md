The main prototype of the code is done but there are some minor issues. 


# TODO (Short term). 
1) Distribute wfcs across all the kpools (now data is duplicated)
2) Compute the representation matrices to rotate in q space
3) Rearrange non-local part (compute beta functions at the start and blocking (loop tiling))
4) Prepare test cases
5) Improve OPENMP

# TODOs (LONG TERM)
1) Prepare an interface 
2) read dvscf directlty from binary


# Some Uncertain improvements (should be addressed after return)
1) dVloc routines needs to be slightly rewritten to avoid multiple array allocations
